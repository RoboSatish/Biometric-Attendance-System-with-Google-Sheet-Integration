# Biometric-Attendance-System-with-Google-Sheet-Integration
In industrial and domestic applications, attendance registering is important at each and every moment. Many industries face a lot of problems due to the lack of a proper attendance monitoring system. To overcome this, we must need a tamper-proof, unattended, and fast attendance registering system, and the best way for it is to use a biometrics identification system.
Among the various biometric identification systems, Fingerprint identification is one of the most well-known and commonly used ones as it is fast, reliable, and tamper-proof. Because of their uniqueness & consistency over time, fingerprints have been used for identification for many years, more recently becoming automated due to advancements in computing capabilities.
